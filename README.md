### Installation and requirements

1. **Detectron2**. The detector was built using Facebook's Dectron2. More specifically, [conansherry's Windows build of Detectron2](https://github.com/conansherry/detectron2). Follow that repo's intructions on how to install Detectron2, [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), torchvision, [OpenCV](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/opencv), [fvcore](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fvcore), [pycocotools](https://github.com/philferriere/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI) and cython. I have also put together a [tutorial on how to install Detectron2 on Windows](https://github.com/tunai/hybrid-boat-detection/blob/master/install_detectron2_win10.md) with specific package versions which you can follow (both guides will work).  
Although not yet tested, the boat detector should work with the original Linux release of Detectron2. Once you are done, check the installation on your Python environment: 
        
```python
import detectron2
detectron2.__version__
```
You should be able to see the version of your Detectron2 (e.g., "0.1") if the installation was sucessful. 

2. Clone and install this repo and its supporting packages (with your Detectron2 python environment activated on Anaconda prompt):
```
git clone https://github.com/tunai/hybrid-boat-detection
cd hybrid-boat-detection
conda install -c anaconda xlsxwriter
```
3. Test the hybrid boat detector:
```python
python main.py
```       
Your output should look like [this](https://github.com/tunai/storage/blob/master/images/hybrid-boat-detector/in-line-output.jpg?raw=true).

### Usage

#### Generic data and output structure

To run the detector with sample data, simply call ```python main.py```. The detector reads all *.jpg* and *.png* images on the subfolders inside of *"./data/"*. Each run will generate the following output on each subfolder: 

<img align="center" src="https://github.com/tunai/storage/blob/master/images/hybrid-boat-detector/output_structure.jpg?raw=true">  

The highlighted images showing the final output of detected boats are located in *"./positiveHybrid/"*. Here's an example: 

<img align="center" src="https://github.com/tunai/storage/blob/master/images/hybrid-boat-detector/example_detection.jpg?raw=true">  

Red bounding boxes indicate boats identified using small time series and a novel bi GMM system in the Detector of Small Marine Vessels (DSMV). Mid- and large-sized boats are tipically recognized with the use of pre-trained end-to-end object detectors (yellow bounding boxes). The Hybrid system combines both outputs, resulting in a system capable of identifying boats ranging from pixel-level (~80 pixels of area) to large (>1,500 pixels of area).  

The output folders also contain two *.xlsx* spreadsheets ([example](https://github.com/tunai/storage/blob/master/images/hybrid-boat-detector/example_spr.jpg?raw=true)) that specify, for each image, how many boats were found, the detection certainty scores and individual bounding boxes coordinates. 
Note: **OD** indicates detection using pre-trained DL-based object detectors only, while **Hybrid** indicates the final, hybrid results. 

#### Using your own data

0. **Preliminary considerations**: this detector was developed to use small time series of three monitoring images captured 5 seconds apart from each other using a static camera. You can try different capture layouts, but please keep in mind the system's original intent and assumptions when using it. 

1. **Data placement and naming conventions**: place your images in subfolders inside of *"./data/"* (as in the samples provided). Each scene should be represented by a group of three images named using the following convention "prefix+YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.format", where *prefix* is the name of the site, and *format* is either *".jpg"* or *".png"*. For example: consider a subfolder containing nine images (i.e., three groups of three images) for a test site called "site1": 
```
site1_2018-08-21_20-37-12.jpg
site1_2018-08-21_20-37-17.jpg
site1_2018-08-21_20-37-22.jpg
site1_2018-08-21_22-05-01.jpg
site1_2018-08-21_22-05-06.jpg
site1_2018-08-21_22-05-11.jpg
site1_2018-08-21_23-25-13.jpg
site1_2018-08-21_23-25-18.jpg
site1_2018-08-21_23-25-23.jpg
```
**Note**: your images need to be placed in **subfolders** from *"./data/"*. 

2. **Adjusting detection parameters**: If doing research or using your own data, change the hyper-parameters of *config.py* to test different backbones, thresholds, etc. Three hyper-parameters determine the detection sub-regions in the image to be considered by both the DSMV and end-to-end object detector: *upper_ylimit*, *DSMV_ylimit* and *OD_ylimit*. 

<img align="center" src="https://github.com/tunai/storage/blob/master/images/hybrid-boat-detector/bands.png?raw=true"> 

Detection bounding boxes whose top-left y-coordinates fall outside these bands are ignored. When first using your data, manually determine the detection bands you wish to use for the DSMV (usually smaller, given that small vessels are only expected farther away from the camera), and the end-to-end object detector (larger band, considering that these detectors can identify medium- and large-sized boats alike). These detection bands are going to be fixed throught a whole detection session, thus we recommend dividing the data into individual "layouts" (e.g., camera position), where a set of detection bands is valid. These bands are useful for ignoring irrelevant regions of the image (e.g., skyline or stactic foreground closer to the camera).  

The *OD_detection_threshold* determines detection score threshold for object detectors. Other hyper-parameters include the custom- and pre-trained models used and directories for inputs and outputs. Refer to the "help" describing each of them inside *config.py*.  

3. **Running the detection**: once your images are placed in *"./data/"* and your inference parameters are set, run ```python main.py``` and subfolders will be created with the outputs described above.
